**Sorting Made Easy** My submission is a Playground designed to teach computer science students about popular sorting algorithms. To accomplish this I've created an interactive scene that will take in a photo and then sort the people in the photo by height from shortest to tallest. I am able to compare each persons hight by detecting the facial feature bounds of each person and then comparing each persons facial bounds Y coordinate.

## Examples
#### Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort
